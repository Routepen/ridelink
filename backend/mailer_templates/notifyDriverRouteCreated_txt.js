Now all you have to do is add your Routepen link " + herelink + " to your Rideshare post. It takes 10 seconds now riders join your waitlist when your ride's full! Keep in mind your route is only useful if you share it!\n\n"+
  "Then just sit back and wait for riders to enter their dropoff locations on the map and confirm the ones you like. We'll even help you by giving you an email every time a rider signs up. (Excess riders will automatically be added to the waitlist) :) Hope that helps!\n\n"+
