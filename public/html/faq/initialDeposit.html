  <div>Requiring an intial deposit means an additional 2 or 3 dollar surcharge. For example, if
    you want $20 per seat each rider will have to pay $22 or $23. The extra money is used to help
    make online payments possible, and we believe it's a small price to pay for security from bailing riders<div>
