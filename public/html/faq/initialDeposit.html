  <div>Keep in mind! Riders will be charged an additional $2 or $3 extra if you use initial deposit, but don't worry you'll still make the same amount :).
     A $20 ride will now cost $22. The extra money is used to help
    make online payments possible, and we believe it's a small price to pay for security from bailing riders<div>
